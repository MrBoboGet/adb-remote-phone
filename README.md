# ADB Remote Phone

Inspired by the similar projects [adb-remote-control](https://github.com/oberien/adb-remote-control) and [adbcontrol](http://marian.schedenig.name/2014/07/03/remote-control-your-android-phone-through-adb/). Both of these use screenshots to feed screen information, but it is possible to record the screen and stream it in realtime instead, which is much more efficient. 

## Dependencies
Requires adb and ffmpeg
